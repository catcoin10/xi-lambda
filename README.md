# xi-lambda
<b>A googological function involving binary lambda calculus and oracle functions. This repository will track its progress and computation, including lower bounds.</b>

This function is based on Adam Goucher's xi function, which is defined as the longest finite run of a SKI calculus machine that halts. This program, like the xi function, uses an oracle method to go faster than the Busy Beaver function, because it can encode Busy Beavers themselves.

The code here was largely generated by ChatGPT. However, it is simply being used to implement my ideas as real programming in the fraction of the time that making such programs myself would create. These are my original ideas.
